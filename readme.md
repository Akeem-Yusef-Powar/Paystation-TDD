# Requirements



### Jacob

The requirements for this project were to implement some logic for the paystation, create unit tests for said logic, and practice using TDD. Lastly, was the requirement to use git in a collaborative manner with another team member. I would say this went quite smoothly and I don't recall having any git hiccups like a merge conflict. We benefited from this by being able to see each other's changes as well as making changes to each other's code. Yes, we implemented everything that was asked. I believe so, the requirements did not explicitly mention having to create a hashmap but we went ahead and added one so we could keep state of each coin denomination we accumulated.


### Akeem

This lab required us to implement an empty method, alter the cancel method and run unit testing on the Paystation package. Entry returns the total amount of money collected by the paystation since the last called. Cancel returns total amount entered via the same value coins entered.
These changes had to be implemented by a team, using GitHub to keep track of/manage updates to the source files.Everything asked for was implemented and an additional function was added for testing purposes.

**Team Members:** Akeem , Jacob



### Jacob

I was responsible for working on bullet points 1, 2, 3, 4. This required creating both unit tests as well as filling in some logic. I would say the task #4 `Call to cancel returns a map containing one coin entered` was the one that required the most thinking, although not too difficult. It involved setting up a counter dictionary within the test. Other than that, the code I contributed was mostly tests aside from changing one of the given functions type. That is, changing `cancel()` method from void to HashMap.

### Akeem

I implemented the hashmap, the original cancel function and wrote bullet pointed tests 5,6,7 & 8. The cancel function later become a collaborative effort as both Jacob and I needed to call it for tests. I added a function that shows the current state of the map without adding or clearing it so expected maps could be compared with actual maps.
